# active-tab-toggler
toggle between current tab and last active tab with your keyboard

## The Story

Jumped ship from Chrome, was using an extension to jump between last active tabs and wanted the same functionality on Firefox. Three doritos later I found myself learning how extensions are written for Firefox and made one myself. Since I don't like or care about loading it manually or using the `about:debugging` options to load it and just wanted it to be persistent and to sync across my other machines I'm trying to publish it on the Mozilla Add-on page (?). 

## What it Does

Just go back and forth between the last active tabs you are using pressing `ALT+W`

## Coming next...

There's a chance for an update, if I learn how to handle keyboard shortcuts so I give you the option to change it. I'm not interested, so feel free if you know what are you doing to play around with my horrible code and fix/add this or any other stuff you think would be handy to have.
