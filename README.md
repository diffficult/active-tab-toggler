> 🦊 A Firefox extension to quickly toggle between your current and last active tab with customizable keyboard shortcuts.

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 Toggle between current and last active tab
- ⌨️ Customizable keyboard shortcuts (default: `ALT + W`)
- 🔄 Seamless tab switching experience
- 🚀 Lightweight and performance-friendly

## 🤔 Why Active Tab Toggler?

After migrating from Chrome to Firefox, I missed the ability to quickly jump between my last active tabs. Instead of settling for manual tab switching, I decided to create this extension to bring this essential functionality to Firefox. This project started as a learning journey into Firefox extension development and evolved into a useful tool that I now use daily.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. Press `ALT + W` (default) to switch between your current tab and the last active tab
2. Customize your preferred keyboard shortcut in the extension settings
3. That's it! No complicated menus or configurations needed

## ⚙️ Customizing Shortcuts

1. Navigate to `about:addons` in Firefox
2. Click on the ⚙️ gear icon next to Active Tab Toggler
3. Select "Manage Extension Shortcuts"
4. Set your preferred keyboard combination

## 🚀 Installation

The extension will soon be available on the Mozilla Add-ons marketplace. Stay tuned for updates!
